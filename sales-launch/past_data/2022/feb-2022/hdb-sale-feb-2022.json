You can choose from 443 units of 2-room Flexi, 3-, and 4-room flats.\t\t\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\tDakota Crest\u2019s design is inspired by the blocks previously located at Dakota Crescent, paying homage to the previous estate through use of motifs, colours, and detailing in its facade and facilities. Facilities at Dakota Crest include a residents\u2019 network centre, a childcare centre, children\u2019s playgrounds, as well as adult and elderly fitness stations, some of which are set against the backdrop of Geylang River. The development will also come with a precinct pavilion and three roof gardens located on top of the Multi-Storey Car Park (MSCP) and two of the residential blocks.\n\t\t&lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\tPlease refer to the site plan for the facilities provided in the development.

There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.\n         &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n         In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes.

The Plantation Farmway will run through the precincts, and spaces will be set aside for residents to enjoy community gardening and urban farming in their own neighbourhood. Key amenities such as a Community Club, Neighbourhood Centre, and a shopping street will line the Plantation Farmway, making it a vibrant spot for residents to gather. \n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\n            </p>\n        </overview>\n        <notes>\n            <p>\n                \n         HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.\n         &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n         In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes.

Residents can look forward to nature-centric neighbourhoods that offer a strong sense of place, better well-being, and an enhanced quality of life. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        A town-wide Active, Beautiful, and Clean Waters design strategy will be introduced to draw people closer to nature, with a variety of outdoor spaces and landscape features which slow down and treat stormwater runoff. For more details on Tengah town, you may visit &lt;a href=\"https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10349p.nsf/tengah/indexcopy.html\">HDB\u2019s exhibition&lt;/a>.\n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Tengah will be the first town to integrate housing developments with the area\u2019s surrounding greenery and biodiversity. One major attraction will be the approximately 100-metre wide and 5km long Forest Corridor, which will form part of the larger network of greenery that connects the Western Water Catchment Area and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. In collaboration with the National Parks Boards, various tree species will be planted in the Forest Corridor to transform it into a rich forest habitat. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Complementing the Forest Corridor is the Forest Fringe, a 15- to 20-metre wide linear greenscape that will provide a tranquil and rustic environment for residents to enjoy flora and fauna. In addition, extensive park spaces, such as the Central Park and Community Farmways, will string key amenities and facilities together, providing a safe environment for residents to access their daily amenities.\n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Tengah will be the first HDB town to have a car-free town centre nestled next to a lush green park. To encourage green commuting, there will be dedicated walking and cycling paths along all roads to create seamless connections within the town. The upcoming Jurong Region Line and bus services will serve the public transport needs of residents. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Tengah is also the first HDB town to be planned with town-wide smart technologies from the outset. Guided by HDB\u2019s Smart Town Framework, the various districts will integrate smart technology in its design, so that residents can enjoy a quality living environment. Autonomous vehicles will be piloted in Tengah town to provide convenient first-mile-last-mile connection to key transport nodes and amenities. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Vibrant commercial facilities are planned for the town centre and in the districts, complementing other shopping and dining options in the nearby Bukit Batok town.

There are green and blue spaces found within Park District, such as the Plantation and Garden Farmways, Rainforest Walk, Forest Stream, green links, rain gardens, and skyrise greenery. These spaces provide visual relief and create more outdoor recreational opportunities for residents.\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\tPark District is also home to the Market Place, Singapore\u2019s first car-free HDB town centre which will provide a safe environment for walking and cycling. The town centre will be set amidst a lush park, with vehicles plying underneath the town centre. It will offer a greener, car-lite, people-friendly, and pedestrian-friendly environment.\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\n            </p>\n        </overview>\n        <notes>\n            <p>\n                \n         HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.\n         &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n         In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes.

HDB has applied its Biophilic Town Framework to guide the enhancement of existing natural assets and the design and development of neighbourhood landscapes in Tengah. Residents can look forward to nature-centric neighbourhoods that offer a strong sense of place, better well-being, and an enhanced quality of life. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        A town-wide Active, Beautiful, and Clean Waters design strategy will be introduced to draw people closer to nature, with a variety of outdoor spaces and landscape features which slow down and treat stormwater runoff. For more details on Tengah town, you may visit &lt;a href=\"https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10349p.nsf/tengah/indexcopy.html\">HDB\u2019s exhibition&lt;/a>.\n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Tengah will be the first town to integrate housing developments with the area\u2019s surrounding greenery and biodiversity. One major attraction will be the approximately 100-metre wide and 5km long Forest Corridor, which will form part of the larger network of greenery that connects the Western Water Catchment Area and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. In collaboration with the National Parks Boards, various tree species will be planted in the Forest Corridor to transform it into a rich forest habitat. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Complementing the Forest Corridor is the Forest Fringe, a 15- to 20-metre wide linear greenscape that will provide a tranquil and rustic environment for residents to enjoy flora and fauna. In addition, extensive park spaces, such as the Central Park and Community Farmways, will string key amenities and facilities together, providing a safe environment for residents to access their daily amenities.\n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Tengah will be the first HDB town to have a car-free town centre nestled next to a lush green park. To encourage green commuting, there will be dedicated walking and cycling paths along all roads to create seamless connections within the town. The upcoming Jurong Region Line and bus services will serve the public transport needs of residents. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Tengah is also the first HDB town to be planned with town-wide smart technologies from the outset. Guided by HDB\u2019s Smart Town Framework, the various districts will integrate smart technology in its design, so that residents can enjoy a quality living environment. Autonomous vehicles will be piloted in Tengah town to provide convenient first-mile-last-mile connection to key transport nodes and amenities. \n        &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n        Vibrant commercial facilities are planned for the town centre and in the districts, complementing other shopping and dining options in the nearby Bukit Batok town.

Yishun Boardwalk comprises 8 residential blocks ranging from 10 to 15 storeys in height. You can choose from 852 units of 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, and 5-room flats. Flats in this development will have a shorter waiting time.\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n    3 of the residential blocks in Yishun Boardwalk will come with roof gardens, where residents can enjoy views of the scenic Sungei Khatib Bongsu and the neighbourhood park. Inspired by the nearby nature trails, Yishun Boardwalk features lush walking trails lined with active spaces for residents to explore. These active spaces comprise children\u2019s playgrounds, adult and elderly fitness corners, a hardcourt, two precinct pavilions, and a residents\u2019 network centre. The development\u2019s 7-storey Multi-storey Car Park also comes with a verdant rooftop garden that has resting spots for residents to unwind. \n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n    Please refer to the site plan for the facilities provided in the development. Facilities in this development will be accessible by the public.\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\n            </p>\n        </overview>\n        <notes>\n            <p>\n                \n         HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.\n         &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n         In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes. Hence, residents may experience higher noise levels.

The development's facade resembles groves of trees with the use of earthy colours inspired by a forest theme. Grove Spring @ Yishun takes its name from this design concept.\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n    This development comprises eight 15-storey residential blocks. You can choose from 987 units of 2-room Flexi, 3-, 4-, and 5-room flats. Flats in this development will have a shorter waiting time.\n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n    Grove Spring @ Yishun will feature a range of recreational facilities, such as playgrounds, adult and elderly fitness stations, and a roof garden atop the Multi-Storey Car Park (MSCP).  A residents\u2019 network centre and a childcare centre will also be located within the development. Please refer to the site plan for the facilities provided in the development. Facilities in this development will be accessible by the public.  \n    &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n\t\n            </p>\n        </overview>\n        <notes>\n            <p>\n                \n         HDB precincts are planned to serve the evolving needs of the community. There are spaces catered for future inclusion of amenities/ facilities (such as childcare centres, elderly-related facilities, education centres, residents' network centres, day activity centres, etc), commercial facilities (such as shops and eating houses), mechanical and electrical rooms, and such other facilities depending on the prevailing needs. These spaces could be in the void decks, common property, car parks, or stand-alone community buildings.\n         &lt;br/>&lt;br/>\n         In addition, housing projects may be located near roads, railways, airbases, and land used for non-residential purposes. Hence, residents may experience higher noise levels.
